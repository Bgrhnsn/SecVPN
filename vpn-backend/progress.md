# VPN Application Progress

## Completed:

### Frontend (VpnApp1):
- Set up React Native project with navigation
- Created screens and VPN functionality
- Fixed issues with VPN connection status display and monitoring
- Implemented real-time network metrics (download/upload speeds, ping) with 60-second refresh
- Created settings management (Auto Connect, Kill Switch, Split Tunneling) using AsyncStorage
- Added UI for different country servers (connects to a single backend server)

### Backend (vpn-backend):
- Set up Express + TypeScript project
- Added dependencies: Mongoose, bcryptjs, JWT, dotenv, CORS
- Created MongoDB models:
  - User (authentication)
  - VpnSession (tracking connections)
  - VpnServer (server details)
- Implemented authentication middleware
- Created controllers:
  - Authentication (register, login, profile)
  - User management (update profile, delete user, list users)
  - VPN operations (connect, disconnect, status, server management)
- Created route handlers:
  - Auth routes
  - User routes
  - VPN routes

## To Do:

### Backend:
1. ✅ Create route handlers for auth, user, and VPN endpoints
2. ✅ Implement VPN controller for connection management
3. ✅ Add user controller for profile management
4. Implement OpenVPN configuration and process management
5. Add error handling and validation middleware
6. Implement server status monitoring
7. Create API endpoints for metrics collection

### Frontend-Backend Integration:
1. Connect the React Native frontend to the backend API
2. Implement proper authentication flow
3. Set up real-time communication for VPN status
4. Add error handling and recovery mechanisms

### Deployment:
1. Configure production environment
2. Set up proper MongoDB connection
3. Implement secure environment variable handling
4. Set up OpenVPN integration
5. Create deployment scripts
